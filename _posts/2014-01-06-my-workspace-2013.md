I've always enjoyed looking at [other peoples workspaces](http://lifehacker.com/tag/workspace-show-and-tell), so here is my workspace show and tell.
***

![My_Workspace](/media/my-workspace.jpg)

What is in the picture (top to bottom):

* **[Logitech C310 HD Webcam](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-960-000586-C310-HD-Webcam/dp/B003R1P8WY)** - Decent value and quality. You might only use it once in a while but a webcam is a must if you have a desktop computer.
* **[Acer S240HLbid 24'' LED Monitor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005QVZ79C)** - This is a really slim and light monitor, perfect if you move around a lot. It has two digital inputs (HDMI and DVI) which is a plus if you want to run two computers or just to hook up a Raspberry Pi.
* **Potted Plant** - Bring the outdoors in!
* **Anglepoise Lamp** - I find a lamp is mush easier on the eyes compared to lighting the whole room.
* **[Creative T20 Speakers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-Gigaworks-Series-Multimedia-Speakers/dp/B001IZZ2PE)** - I'm no audiophile but these speakers sound pretty good to me.
* **Half Finished Arduino Project** - Some day I'll get around to finishing it.
* **[Apple Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/ie/mac-mini/)** - I decided to go with a desktop computer when I was last upgrading. The mac mini is unobtrusive and much more reasonably priced than the MacBooks. I've upgraded it with an additional 250GB SSD (used as a boot partition, leaving the HDD for file storage) and 16GB ram.
* **[Logitech MX Wireless Mouse](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Wireless-Performance-Mouse-Tracks/dp/B002L3TSKC)** - Although a bit pricey this mouse is incredibly comfortable. I've had a few issues with it tracking on glossy surfaces, but apart from that it is by far my favourite mouse (even more than my [work mouse](http://www.handshoemouse.com/)).
* **[Apple Wireless Keyboard](http://store.apple.com/ie/product/MC184B/B/apple-wireless-keyboard)** - You either love this low profile minimalist Apple keyboard or you hate it... I love it!
* **[Wacom Bamboo Graphics Tablet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wacom-Bamboo-Pen-Graphics-Tablet/dp/B005TYVS4Y)** - I don't use this as often as I'd like but it's nice to have it there if I need to do any graphics or photo editing.

What isn't in the picture:

* **[Synology DS211j NAS](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Synology-DS213J-Bay-Desktop-Enclosure/dp/B00CDG2XHC)** - Two 4TB WD Red HDD in RAID 1 allow me to backup all my photos, music and videos and access them from the internet. Also works with Apples Time Machine for  full computer backups.
* **[ASUS RT-AC66U Gigabit WLAN Router](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-RT-AC66U-AC1750-Gigabit-Router/dp/B00897IKNK)** - This is a seriously robust and feature full router. I've updated it to [Merlin's](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin) firmware which offers quicker bug fixes and a few nice additional features (OpenVPN and the ability to turn off status lights on the router being the main ones I use).
