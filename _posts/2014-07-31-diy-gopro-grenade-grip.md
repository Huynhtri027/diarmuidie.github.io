I had a few GoPro parts laying around so I make myself a DIY GoPro Grenade Grip. The grip is rubberised so it provides good drip in dry and wet conditions.

##Parts List##

![GoPro DIY Grip Parts List](/media/gopro-grenade/parts-list.jpg)

* GoPro with mount (the water proof case that comes with the camera will do).
* Mini paint roller handle (I got [this one](http://www.diy.com/nav/decor/decorating-tools-and-supplies/painting-decorating-tools/rollers___pads/-brand-Diall/Diall-4-Mini-Roller-and-Tray-Set-12599285) from B&Q).
* 2 inch long Â¼ inch diameter bolt and nut (I struggled to find this size in Ireland where metric bolts are more common).
* GoPro tripod adapter.
* GoPro mounting screw (Again comes with the camera).

##Method##

###Step 1.###

Pull the metal roller holder out of the handle. A bit of brute strength should get it out. Standing on the metal bit helps as well.

###Step 2.###

Thread the bolt into the hole left from the metal bar and lock it in place with a nut.

###Step 3.###

Screw the tripod mount onto the bolt. If necessary you can trim down the length of the bolt, or add a few washers, for a better fit.

###Step 4 (Optional).###

Seal between the roller handle and the tripod mount with epoxy or [Sugru](http://sugru.com/) to make sure the bolt will not come undone or rotate.

And there you have it a waterproof, sturdy, grippy and inexpensive GoPro grenade style grip.
