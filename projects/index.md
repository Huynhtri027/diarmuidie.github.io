# Some of My Projects:

*   [NiceID](https://github.com/diarmuidie/niceid) - PHP package to generate short, non-sequential, URL-friendly IDs from integers.
*   [Diarmuid.ie Version 1.0](http://archive.diarmuid.ie) - For posterity I've moved my old site and blog to a subdomain. Built on wordpress with blood sweat and tears!
*   [SimLog](https://github.com/diarmuidie/SimLog) - The software that <strike>powers this site!</strike> (Now powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)).
*   [Warmer Than](http://wt.diarmuid.ie/) - A simple weather site that compares the coming weather with yesterdays weather. Alpha site, still being developed.
